At Strategybyte, we use smart, data-driven strategies like SEO, Google Ads, and content creation to help your business get noticed online. The goal? To reach the right people and turn them into customers.",

      {
        question:
          "Why is digital marketing important for Australian businesses?",
        answer:
          "More and more Australians are searching online before they buy. If your business doesn't show up, you're missing out. A good digital marketing strategy builds trust, helps people find you easily, and gives you an edge over the competition. Whether you're in health, education, or retail, we help you get found and grow.",

        question: "How much does digital marketing cost?",
        answer:
          "Costs can vary based on what you need. For example, targeting customers in a specific city or running ongoing campaigns might require more work. At Strategybyte, we keep pricing clear. We'll work with your goals and budget to build a plan that fits.",

        question:
          "What services are included in your digital marketing packages?",
        answer:
          "We offer everything you need to grow online. That includes SEO (so you rank higher on Google), paid ads (for fast traffic), social media management (to connect with your audience), website design (to convert visitors into leads), and tracking tools (to measure results). We also create content that helps your business stand out in searches.",
      },
      {
        question: "How soon will I see results?",
        answer:
          "You won't see results overnight, digital marketing takes time. Most of our clients see noticeable improvements in 6 to 12 weeks. We focus on both short-term wins and long-term growth, so your business keeps improving month after month.",

      {
        question: "Can digital marketing help me get more leads?",
        answer:
          "Yes, that's one of our main goals. We build landing pages, run targeted ads, and improve your site to turn visitors into customers. We also track what's working (and what's not) so we can keep improving your results.",

        question: "What makes Strategybyte different from other agencies?",
        answer:
          "We're based in Australia and understand the local market. Unlike one-size-fits-all agencies, we tailor our approach to your business and audience. We use smart tools to find what people are searching for, and we turn that into strategies that work. We're clear, results-driven, and easy to work with.",

        question: "What is SEO, and why do I need it?",
        answer:
          "SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It's how you help your website appear on Google when people search for things related to your business. Without it, even the best-looking site can be invisible online. At Strategybyte, we use SEO to help people find your business when they're actually looking for your services.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does SEO actually help my business?",
        answer:
          "Good SEO means more people can find you online, which can lead to more calls, bookings, and sales. Whether you're a local service provider or a growing brand, SEO helps you show up in front of the right people without paying for ads every time.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does SEO take to work?",
        answer:
          "SEO isn't instant, it's more like building a strong foundation. Most of our clients start seeing improvements within a few months, and the results keep growing over time. We focus on steady, long-term growth that pays off.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is SEO really worth the investment?",
        answer:
          "Yes, because once your site starts ranking, the traffic you get doesn't cost you per click like paid ads do. It's one of the most cost-effective ways to bring in ongoing leads and grow your business online.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can you help my local business show up in search results?",
        answer:

        question: "Do I need to keep doing SEO every month?",
