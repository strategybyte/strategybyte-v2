          "SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It’s how you help your website appear on Google when people search for things related to your business. Without it, even the bestlooking site can be invisible online. At Strategybyte, we use SEO to help people find your business when they’re actually looking for your services.",

        question: "4. Is SEO really worth the investment?",
        answer:
