        answer:
          " Analytics and reporting involve tracking data from your website, ads, or campaigns and turning that information into meaningful insights. It helps you understand what’s working, what isn’t, and where to focus your efforts. Whether it's traffic sources or lead conversions, we make sense of your numbers so you can make smarter business decisions.",

        question: "2. Why do I need analytics and reporting for my business?",
        answer:
          "Without data, you're guessing. With proper analytics and clear reporting, you can see where your visitors come from, which pages they engage with, and how your campaigns perform. Our clients use these insights to improve results and cut wasted spend.",
      },
      {
        question: "3. What tools do you use for analytics and reporting?",
        answer:
          "We use tools like Google Analytics, Search Console, and custom dashboards that show you the data that matters most. For businesses that use SEO and paid ads, we integrate performance tracking so you always know your return on investment.",
      },
      {
        question: "4. What’s the difference between reporting and analytics?",
        answer:
          "Reporting shows you what happened (e.g., traffic numbers, bounce rates), while analytics helps you understand why it happened. At Strategybyte, we combine bothso you're not just getting numbers, you're getting clear recommendations.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "5. Can you explain how Google Analytics tracks user behavior?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Google Analytics tracks user actions on your website like which pages they visit, how long they stay, or where they drop off. This helps us optimize your site and improve user experience. We break it all down in plain language, so you don’t need to be a data expert.",
